# Silent Failure in Asynchronous File I/O

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous programming: silent failure due to unhandled exceptions within asynchronous callbacks. The `bug.js` file shows a program that attempts to read a file asynchronously.  If the file does not exist or there's another I/O error, the program doesn't report it effectively, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js` (this might not fail if the file exists)
3.  To trigger the error, either rename or delete `./my-file.txt`, or create the file with insufficient permissions.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.

## Problem and Solution

The problem is with the error handling in the asynchronous `fs.readFile` call. The `bug.js` example only catches the error within the `readFileAsync` function, which prevents the program from crashing, but doesn't provide a mechanism to report the error in a user-friendly way.  This can make debugging significantly more challenging. 

The `bugSolution.js` corrects this by using `try...catch` to handle any errors originating from `readFileAsync`, ensuring that any errors are appropriately logged and the program's failure is transparent.
